# rpi-dead-man-alarm (RDMA)

Rpi Dead Man Alarm - Software - Occupancy Monitoring - Raspberry Pi hat

please refer to the wiki for pictures of the setup [RDMA Wiki](https://github.com/SkullKill/RDMA/wiki)

Design for **Monitoring Occupancy in a control room**. It will start to Beep by default 60 sec before the timer expires, if the timer expires, it will send Alerts via SMS using [clicksend](https://www.clicksend.com/) to the configured phone numbers. The timer will reset itself using an off the shelf PIR sensor (Alarm sensor) or by manually pressing the reset buttin, or by issuing reset via the web interface. The timer can be extended once by long pressing the reset button, or via the web interface. It also has the ability to monitor temperature using 1-wire DS18B20 temp sensors. All values are also made available through SNMP for monitoring/alerting. e.g using PRTG/nagios

Use case: for a 24/7 control center with only one person on duty. Alerts people via SMS if the person on duty is unresponsive.

the temperature monitoring has the fetures from [RTSA](https://github.com/SkullKill/RTSA)


All options are completely customizable through the ini config file

The script [RDMA](https://githib.com/SkullKill/RDMA) is design specificly for the Raspberry Pi.

## Install

**make sure that snmpd is installed and configured , install the adafruit HT16K33 library and modify one the library file before installing RDMA**

if using CentOS, there are a few things to install before installing the adafruit library, i.e phthon3 pip, dev libraries and gcc.

    yum install python3-pip python3-devel git git-core i2c-tools gcc net-snmp net-snmp-utils vim mlocate tcpdump bind-utils
    
on CentOS, to enable i2c, create/edit the file /boot/config.txt and add
    
    dtoverlay=w1-gpio
    dtparam=i2c1=on
    dtparam=i2c_arm=on
    dtoverlay=i2c-rtc,ds3231


for the adafruit library, all instruction are there [adafruit_ht16k33](https://learn.adafruit.com/matrix-7-segment-led-backpack-with-the-raspberry-pi/configuring-your-pi-for-i2c)

    sudo pip3 install adafruit-circuitpython-ht16k33

please change POSOTIONS in

    vi /usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/adafruit_ht16k33/segments.py

(in centos, it is at /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/adafruit_ht16k33/segments.py)

to be like

    POSITIONS = (0, 2, 4, 6)  #  The positions of characters.


and finally to install RDMA

    git clone https://github.com/skullkill/rdma
    cd rdma
    chmod +x install.sh && sudo ./install.sh

customise the config as required, then

    systemctl enable rdma
    systemctl start rdma

restart snmpd daemon

    systemctl restart snmpd
    
recommend using somehing like [log2ram](https://github.com/azlux/log2ram) to minimise read/write to sd card.

## Upgrade

MAKE SURE TO BACKUP YOUR config ini file first!!!

You need to stop rtsa (`seystemctl stop rdma`) and start the [install](#install).

## Customize

Config file is at `/etc/rdma.ini` by default

#### [DEFAULT] : default for all sections

anything in the default section will be availabe and be used in all section, unless it is define in a section.
if the variable is defined in a specific section, then that will take precedance over the default values.

Even if not define in the config, the program has it's own default values, which is the same as what is in the original config.

#### [system] : system configuration options

- `temp_values_folder` : current temperature values are stored in this folder. by default it is `/var/log/rdma/temp/` (works well with log2ram)
- `snmp_folder` : where our custom snmp query files will be stored. default is `/usr/local/sbin/snmp/`
- `snmp_config_file` : where the snmpd config file is stored, so that we can add the pass through script in
- `baseID_temp` : first temp sensor will then be baseID_temp+1 .
- `baseID_dma` : snmp id for the dead man alarm timer
- `delay_startup` : delay when running the program for the 1st time at boot. default is `10` sec (can be set to 10.2 etc)
- `delay_cycle` : how long to wait after finishing a complete cycle to re run the cycle of updating the temperature/relay. e.g. if you are querying via snmp every 1 min, it is pointless to keep updating the temperature values. default is `5.0` sec
- `timer_normal` : How long to wait without movement before triggering the alarm. default is `300` seconds. (5 min)
- `timer_extended` : How long to wait without movement before triggering the alarm (extended mode). default is `900` seconds. (15 min)
- `httpd_address` : local address to listen to. if set to `localhost` (default), web interface will only we accessible locally, if set to `0.0.0.0`, it will be accessible from anywhere, from any interface.
- `httpd_port` : tcp port to listen on for the web interface. default is `80`

NOTE: if accessible from public places, recomend changing this to something like localhost and port 8000, then setup appache as a proxy. it will be a more secure setup. https/ssl can then be configured along with authentication. 

#### [clicksend] : clicksend.com config
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is 1
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is 1
- `type` : type of subsection, has to be set to `smsgateway`
- `username` : username of your clicksend account
- `api` : API key of your clicksend account
- `message` : message sent via sms e.g `DeadMan Alarm timerout at SOMEPLACE`


#### [1X] : SMS recipient
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is 1
- `name` : name of recipient (will also be included in the sms)
- `type` : type of subsection, has to be set to `smsnumber`
- `phone` : mobile phone number to send sms to. please include contrycode e.g `+61412345678`

#### [pinout] : 

this section is for referance only, it can be completely removed from the config

#### [mute_button] : to mute/stop the strobe/siren/doorBell/relay for X amount of minutes. or toogle mode.

- `name` : name of section
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is 1
- `type` : type of subsection. has to be set to `input`
- `gpio` : pin to use for input (in BCM numbering). Default is 13
- `state` : default state when starting up. if `0` (default). will set pull down resistor, and wait for 3.3v to be applied to activate. if set to `1`, will set pull up resistor, and wait for connection to ground to activate. (recommend using state = 1 )
- `mute_mode : can be toogle or momentary . in toogle mode, it will to off untill the mute button is pressed again. default is momentary
- `timer` : how long in minutes to stop the alarm (relays,strobe,siren,doorBell) It is not an always mute untill pressed again sort of setup. configued that way so that we do not accidently forget it in the mute state. default is 15 min



#### [10X] : Temperature Sensors

the section has to be an integer value. if the system base_ID_temp is 100, then the 1st temperature sensor should be 100 + 1 = 101


- `name` : name of section
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is 1
- `type` : type of subsection. has to be set to `temp`
- `file`: location of 1-wire DS18B20 temp sensor read file location. usually in `/sys/bus/w1/devices/SERIALnumber/w1_slave`
- `upper_alert_value`: will alarm if temp is higher than this value. default is `5` fridge should be set to around 5, freezer to around -18
- `lower_alert_value`: will alarm if temp is lower than this value. default is `-23` fridge should be set to around 0, freezer to around -23
- `sensor_offset`: sensor correction offset. default is `0`
- `delay_before` : delay before quering the sensor (in sec). default is `0`
- `delay_after` : delay after quering the sensor (in sec). default is `1`
- `sensor_alerting` : if False, will still query the temp sensors, but will not alert if the temp is out of range. configurable via the web interface. NOTE: web interface changes are not permanent.


#### [20X] : Relays/output

this section `name` has to be an integer value.
- `name` : name of section
- `enable` : if `0 or False`, it is disabled. if `1 or True`, it is enabled. default is `1`
- `type` : type of subsection. has to be set to `relay`
- `gpio` : pin to use for input (in BCM numbering)
- `state` : default state when starting up. if `0` (default). will output low in normal state, and output High (3.3v) when in alarm state
- `alarm_range_high_offset` : if sensor upper_alert_value is set to 5, and alarm_range_high_offset is set to 3. relay will not become in alarm state untill the sensor becomes 8 degrees cencius (5 + 3 = 8) . offset will apply to all sensors. Default is `0.0`
- `alarm_range_low_offset` : if sensor lower_alert_value is set to 0, and alarm_range_low_offset is set to -2. relay will not become in alarm state untill the sensor becomes -2 degrees cencius (0 + -2 = -2) . offset will apply to all sensors. Default is `0.0`
- `delay_relay_on` : delay after sensor in alarm state before turning on the relay (in sec). default is `5`
- `delay_relay_off` : delay after sensor has cleared the alarm state, before turning off the relay (in sec). default is `5`
- `relay_mode` : mode of operation of relay. if set to `toogle` (default) when on, will stay on. if set to `momentary` when in alarm state, will turn on for a short time, then turn off and stay off for momentary_relay_timer value
- `momentary_relay_interval` : how long to leave the relay off before turning it on again when in moementary mode (in sec). default is `5.0`
- `momentary_relay_timer` : how long to leave the relay on before turning it on again when in moementary mode (in sec). default is `0.5`


- Note about `[202]` / Buzzer,
- `delay_relay_on` : delay after sensor in alarm state before turning on the relay (in sec). default is `-60` (1 mon)
- `momentary_relay_interval` : how long to leave the relay off before turning it on again when in moementary mode (in sec). default is `5.0`

- `button_times` : how many times to repeet the beep. default is `1`
- `alt_length` : (when activating the extended mode) how long to turn on the buzzer. default is `3`
- `alt_times` : how many times to repeet the beep. default is `1`
- `sms_length` : (when the SMS alerts are being sent) how long to turn on the buzzer. default is `0.2`
- `sms_times` : how many times to repeet the beep. default is `10`




- Note about `[205]` / LED-Status,

if driving the LED direct from the GPIO, a 160ohm will equal to ~10ma, for a 1.7v drop diode, use 320ohm if lots of leds, ~5ma. else you will hit the combine max current of 54ma very quickly

the LED is used as a "is working" status LED. will be up if the RDMA service is running


### It is working?

#### Log files 
You can now check log files

tail -f /var/log/rdma/rdma.log

in CentOS currently it is at 

    tail -f /var/log/messages

to get more logs, edit `vi /usr/local/sbin/rdma_py3.py`
and uncomment the 2 print lines, so that they look like so

```
    # main loop
â¦
        # uncomment the next line, to log when the next cycle is starthing
        print("{} - Starting new cycle".format(datetime.datetime.now()))
â¦
        # uncomment the next line, to log the recorded temperature
        print(temp_values)
â¦

```
to minimise logs, remember to comment them back

#### the temp sensors
you can also do `cat /var/log/rdma/temp/TEMPsensorNAME`

for rdma timer `cat /var/log/rdma/temp/rdma_timer`



#### SNMP section
to test the snmp script `/usr/local/sbin/snmp/snmp-TEMPsensorNAME.sh -g`
to test the snmpd pass through `snmpget -v1 -c public 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.100.1`
to test the snmpd pass through from anohter linux box `snmpget -v1 -c public IPofRaspPi .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.100.1`

OID for rdma_timer .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.10.1
`snmpget -v1 -c public 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.10.1`


###### Now, we can relax :)


setup your SNMP monitoring software to pull info from the RTSA



## Uninstall :(
(Because sometime we need it)
```
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/uninstall-rdma.sh && sudo /usr/local/bin/uninstall-rdma.sh
```

## SNMPD

### SNMPD daemon
some supplement info about setting up SNMPD. this is nowhere complete, but enough to get stated 

apt-get install snmp snmpd

vi /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf

change the lines in the config so they look like so

```
...
#  Listen for connections from the local system only
#agentAddress  udp:127.0.0.1:161
#  Listen for connections on all interfaces (both IPv4 *and* IPv6)
agentAddress udp:161,udp6:[::1]:161

...

#rocommunity public  localhost
                                                 #  Default access to basic system info
 rocommunity public  default    -V systemonly
                                                 #  rocommunity6 is for IPv6
 rocommunity6 public  default   -V systemonly

rocommunity YOURsnmpNAME
...
view all included .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2

```

save and restart

test
snmpwalk -v1 -c YOURsnmpNAME 127.0.0.1 .1.3.6.1.4.1.8072

#### reducing logging output by snmpd
edit `/lib/systemd/system/snmpd.service`
change `-Lsd` to `-LSwd`
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart snmpd

### adding custom sensor in PRTG

auto discover your raspberry pi or add manually, change the SNMP community to what is configured in the pi

add an `SNMP Custom` sensor for one temperature reading per sensor, or an `SNMP Custom Advance` for multiple temp (up to 10) in one sensor.

Name: fridge sensor
OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.100.1
Value Type: Absolute (float)
Sensor Channel Unit: Temperature

Name: RDMA Timer
OID: 1.3.6.1.4.1.8072.2.10.1
Value Type: Absolute (float)
Channel Name: Timer
Unit String : Sec
Sensor Channel Unit: TimeSeconds

after that, when browsing the temperature sensor, you can `Add Threshold Trigger` setup the temp, and config it to email or send SMS notification.


## log2ram

Hightly recommended.
log2ram installation. this is to reduce the ammount of write to the sdcard, therefore extending the sdcard's life

```
git clone https://github.com/azlux/log2ram.git
cd log2ram
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
reboot
```

## Todo

1. poweroff / reboot via webinterface.
2. logs are going to /var/log/syslog instead (need fixing)
